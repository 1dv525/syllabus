## Before you start
Make sure you have watched the introductory demos and resources:

* [Getting started (resource)](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/introduction-to-web-programming/getting-started/)
* [Starting out with the exercises (YouTube)](https://youtu.be/hTGhzYGqLKI)
* *[Fix for one step in the video above](https://youtu.be/0D9dbTJWRMw) Should not be necessary HT2017*


## Exercises
Exercises are not mandantory and will not be corrected by the corse management. However, you will have a better chance of doing the assignments in the course if you first do the exercises.

Exercises below are in seperate branches in the ["exercise"-repo](https://github.com/CS-LNU-Learning-Objects/client-side-javascript-exercise). Please watch the introduction above before continuing. In case you have multiple virtual machines running on you computer you may run in to problem doing `vagrant up`. In that case, please halt the other machines and try `vagrant up` again.

[Read the instructions here](https://github.com/CS-LNU-Learning-Objects/client-side-javascript-exercise/blob/master/README.md) to get started.

To clean up you branch structure and remove old branches you can use the command:

```
git remote update exercises --prune
```

The assignments are devided in to seperate levels, A, B and C where C is the most difficult level. You should always strive to complete at least level A and B.
