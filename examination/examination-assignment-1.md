- create web pages using html and css

### Deadline and submission
* Deadline: 12/9 2016 12.00
* Submit: Submit your assignment by doing a release on GitHub named "v1.0". In case of changes after a released version please use incremental version numbers, i.e. "v1.1", "v1.22 etc.

### Preparation
Make sure you have gone through the [getting stated guide](https://coursepress.lnu.se/kurs/introduction-to-web-programming/getting-started/) and have all the necessary tools installed and have done all registrations.

## Practical assignment
The idea of this practical assignment is that you will create a web site containing a couple of web pages and different kinds of HTML elements. The first part is about structuring the site, in later parts the web site will be styled with CSS.

You are free to use things like static site generators as Jekyll and CSS Preprocessors if you want.

## Part 1 - HTML and structure
In this part we are going to start working with HTML and structure our web site

The web site should at least contain one landing page (start page) and three sub pages. You should be able to click around the site trough a menu that is always present on every page.
The minimum subpages should be:
* About- This page should contain some text about your self (if you want - a fictional person). This page should contain at least:
  * One ordered list
  * One unordered list
  * One working image tag (relative URL to the image)
  * One working video tag (find and use an external URL)
* Blog/news - This page should contain at least two blog posts build by using HTML5 tags
* Contact - This page should contain a correct HTML form supporting an HTTP POST method. The user should be able to enter his/her name (required), email (required),

* All sub pages should be available through a menu that should be present in every page.

For more information see image 1.1 below.

### Think about
* Make sure you structure or files and folders in a good way. Maybe one folder for images, one for pages, one for stylesheets and so on


## Part 2 - CSS

Now it is time to style your HTML pages. All CSS should be in separate files and be linked in trough the stylesheet tag. The web sites layout should be like image 2.1, a simple three-column layout.

* All pages should have the CSS rules to get a consistent feeling.
* All pages should be centered when you resize your web browser window.
* The links (at least in the menu) should have some hover effect (feel free to experiment)
* Use CSS to include at least one background image

## Part 3 - other stuff
* Insert a hCard about you self on your blog page. To do this check out: http://microformats.org/code/hcard/creator. Try it by using: http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets
* Learn about and create a robot.txt for your site. The contact page should not be indexed by search engines
* Learn about and create a human.txt for your site

## Oral hearing
The examination will be done as an oral hearing where you get a couple of theoretical questions from this part and also show your practical assignment. You canÂ´t book a time for oral hearing before you are ready with the assignment and have done a release on GitHub.
